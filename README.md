Plant Disease Detection AI - README
Overview
Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection AI project! This repository contains the code, necessary server files, and dependencies required to build and deploy a machine learning model for detecting plant diseases from images. The model is designed to help farmers and gardeners identify plant diseases early and take appropriate actions to protect their crops.

Features
Image Classification: Detect and identify various plant diseases using AI.
API: RESTful API for integrating the model with other applications.
Scalability: Built with scalable components to handle large volumes of data.
Project Structure
app/: Contains the Flask application code.
models/: Pre-trained models and model training scripts.
nginx/: Nginx configuration files.
gunicorn/: Gunicorn configuration files.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Ubuntu 20.04 Server
Nginx
